# Dynamic Atlas Dashboard

A simple tool for map visualization of Bird Atlases. The Map will show the current staus of bird count coverage across the chosen geographical area, given that its feeder google sheets are properly filled in.

The data is read from a set of google sheets maintained by the Birders.

The site is published via github pages. https://alenalex3112.github.io/bird-atlas-dashboard/
